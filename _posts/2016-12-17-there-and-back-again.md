# My Web Developers Story

I was working at Barnes and Noble, which allowed me to be surrounded by new things regularly. In my course of cleaning up the store, I found myself lingering more and more at the technology section. After glancing over Jon Duckett's beautiful  books and a couple more I have forgetten, I was hit a realization I need to start a career in web development.

After hours of googling, I finally found Bloc and what made it sound out to me was the guidance of a mentor. While I seriously considered using FreeCodeCamp, I knew I needed someone to keep my on the straight path and encourage me when I needed it.

## The Backend

Since I wanted this to be a full career change, I decided to go with the full-stack program. With my natural technical aptitude, things started off pretty well but quickly ran into a snag once that harder concepts started. I struggled to believe I had the ability to understand everything that is needed to be a programmer.

With this stress at work, home, and the rut, I was stuck in with Rails I decided to pause my enrollment for two weeks. Unfortunately, two weeks turned into five months of not programming, which of course hurt my confidence and learning.  There were thoughts I might not start up again, but my mother was adamant that I stay the course. I was able to start back up, blast through the Rails projects and develop a deep love for Rails and Ruby.
